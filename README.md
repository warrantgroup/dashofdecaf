============

Provides a simple story dashboard from Pivotal Tracker inorder to bridge the gap between the mysterious world of software development, and the average end-user waiting for something to happen.

Project was started in response to our internal use of Dash of Agile, we found departments could not filter stories and struggled working out what changes taken place in a certain period. 

One Friday we decided to have a one-day sprint, to create a simple list of stories per epic which could be filtered by story state. Also create a dynamic change log which indicates all new features, fixed bugs and known issues within a period of time. 

Using :

* Twitter Bootstrap 3
* Silex
* Guzzle
* Pivotal Tracker API
